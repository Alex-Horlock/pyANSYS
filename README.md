# pyANSYS
Scripts for automating ANSYS Fluent and SolidWorks Macro with Python

This is a work in progress method for automatically creating new geometry in SolidWorks, importing it to ANSYS Workbench, meshing the geometry to specification, exporting the mesh to ANSYS Fluent and running an example journal file to create a CFD simulation. 

The aim of the project was to reduce the use of the time consuming ANSYS workbench GUI in the meshing project for a 4th year project.
